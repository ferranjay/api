                    Antarctica (UK: /ænˈtɑːrktɪkə/ or /ænˈtɑːrtɪkə/, US: /æntˈɑːrktɪkə/ is Earth's southernmost
                    continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern
                    Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is
                    surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At 14,000,000 square kilometres (5,400,000 square miles), it is
                    the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About
                    98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km (1.2 mi; 6,200 ft) in thickness, which
                    extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.<br><br>

                    Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average
                    elevation of all the continents. Most of Antarctica is a polar desert, with annual precipitation
                    of only 200 mm (8 in) along the coast and far less inland.[7] The temperature in Antarctica has
                    reached −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) (or even −94.7 °C (−135.8 °F) as measured from space[8]), though the
                    average for the third quarter (the coldest part of the year) is −63 °C (−81 °F). Anywhere from 1,000
                    to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at research stations scattered across the continent.
                    Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, protista, and
                    certain animals, such as mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Vegetation, where it
                    occurs, is tundra.

                    Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia,[11] is a sovereign country comprising the
                    mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the
                    largest country in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring
                    countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and
                    Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. The population of 25 million[6] is
                    highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard. Australia's capital is
                    Canberra, and its largest city is Sydney. The country's other major metropolitan areas are
                    Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. <br><br>

                    Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians for about 60,000 years before the first British
                    settlement in the late 18th century. It is documented that Aborigines spoke languages that can be
                    classified into about 250 groups. After the European exploration of the continent by Dutch explorers
                    in 1606, who named it New Holland, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and
                    initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January
                    1788, a date which became Australia's national day. The population grew steadily in subsequent
                    decades, and by the 1850s most of the continent had been explored and an additional five
                    self-governing crown colonies established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming
                    the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political
                    system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and
                    ten territories. <br><br>

                    Being the oldest, flattest and driest inhabited continent,with the least fertile
                    soils, Australia has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi). A
                    megadiverse country, its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes, with deserts in the centre,
                    tropical rainforests in the north-east and mountain ranges in the south-east.

                    South America is a continent in the Western Hemisphere, mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, with a
                    relatively small portion in the Northern Hemisphere. It may also be considered a subcontinent of the
                    Americas,which is how it is viewed in the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking regions of the
                    Americas. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the
                    Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in
                    particular, the rise of Brazil). <br><br>

                    It is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean;
                    North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. It includes twelve sovereign states
                    (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay,
                    and Venezuela), a part of France (French Guiana), and a non-sovereign area (the Falkland Islands, a
                    British Overseas Territory though this is disputed by Argentina). In addition to this, the ABC
                    islands of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Trinidad and Tobago, and Panama may also be considered
                    part of South America. <br><br>

                    South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its population as of
                    2016 has been estimated at more than 420 million.[1] South America ranks fourth in area (after Asia,
                    Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America).
                    Brazil is by far the most populous South American country, with more than half of the continent's
                    population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru.

                North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western
                Hemisphere; it is also considered by some to be a northern subcontinent of the Americas.It is
                bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by
                the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.<br><br>

                North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5%
                of the earth's land area and about 4.8% of its total surface. North America is the third largest
                continent by area, following Asia and Africa, and the fourth by population after Asia, Africa, and
                Europe. In 2013, its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states,
                or about 7.5% of the world's population, if nearby islands (most notably the Caribbean) are included.
                <br><br>
                North America was reached by its first human populations during the last glacial period, via crossing
                the Bering land bridge approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago.

                Asia (/ˈeɪʒə, ˈeɪʃə/ is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located
                primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with
                the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. Asia
                covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30% of Earth's total land area
                and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of
                the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only
                its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely
                populated regions. Its 4.5 billion people (as of September 2018) constitute roughly 60% of the world's
                population.<br><br>

                In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean,
                and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural
                construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat
                arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into
                two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a
                spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the
                east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural
                Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas,
                separating it from Europe

                Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere.
                It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean
                Sea to the south. It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia.<br><br>

                Since around 1850, Europe is most commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides
                of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the
                Turkish Straits. Although the term "continent" implies physical geography, the land border is
                somewhat arbitrary and has been redefined several times since its first conception in classical
                antiquity. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East-West cultural, linguistic and
                ethnic differences which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The geographic
                border also does not follow political boundaries, with Turkey, Russia and Kazakhstan being
                transcontinental countries. A strict application of the Caucasus Mountains boundary also places two
                comparatively small countries, Azerbaijan and Georgia, in both continents.

                Africa is the world's second largest and second most-populous continent (behind Asia in both
                categories). At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers
                6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its land area. With 1.2 billion people as of 2016, it
                accounts for about 16% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean
                Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the
                southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various
                archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de
                facto independent states with limited or no recognition. The majority of the continent and its
                countries are in the Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and number of countries in the
                Southern Hemisphere. <br><br>

                Africa's average population is the youngest amongst all the continents; the median age in 2012 was
                19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4. Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and
                Nigeria is its largest by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as
                the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the
                earliest hominids and their ancestors as well as later ones that have been dated to around 7 million
                years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus,
                H. habilis and H. ergaster—the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human), found in Ethiopia, date to circa
                200,000 years ago. Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the
                only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones
